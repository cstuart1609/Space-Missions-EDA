Space Missions is a dataset which shows a Global rocket launches between 1957-2022. I will performing some initial ETL on the dataset using Power Query before creating a database within DB Browser for SQLite.

Using "" I created a new table which will serve as a look-up table for company/agencies behind the rocket launches. My reasoning behind this is because I wanted to understand trends over time based on volume and success of launches depending on which sector funded and performed the launch.

As a further objective, I am interested in seeing global trends in private spaceflight. While the USA has a very established private sector rocketary industry, I am interested to see which over countries globally are entering the private spaceflight fold and where potential investment in the industry would be well-placed.

In terms of the skills I am developing through-out this project, it would be best to explain my current level. I have previously completed similar projects using RStudio during my University studies, as well as performing a critical analysis on an alternative project of the same dataset. I am not interested in directly using these skills here, although I believe my experience on a previous project will allow me to achieve my goals with less-difficulty.

Instead, I will be using Excel to perform some ETL on the data, where I will make use of my experience using Power Query. To conduct my exploratory data analysis I will be tapping into my SQL skillset, this is something I have developed organically in my professional life where I often query customer and sales data sets. I want to use SQLite as it is different to the SQL I use via Snowflake and in order to build out a dataset from scratch. The reason for this is to A) create tables from scratch and B) to perform joins in order to recover further company and sector detail depending on a range of flights.

The skill that I am looking to develop most in this project is my ability to produce powerful and concise visualisations using Power BI. It is not a package I have used before, however I have used various DAX functions when using Power Pivot within the Excel framework. At work I have created various dashboards using our software "Salesforce" and used ggplot2 during my university projects so I am hopeful that this will prove quite intuitive.
